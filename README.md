# Hi there, I'm Nelson 👋

### Software Engineer | 42 Cadet

I'm a passionate developer currently navigating the rigorous 42 curriculum. I love building robust systems, exploring new technologies, and solving algorithmic challenges. From low-level C programming to full-stack web development with Next.js and AI integrations, I enjoy every layer of the stack.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

I have built a foundation in systems programming through the 42 curriculum, working with memory management and algorithms in **C** and **C++**. I have also expanded into full-stack development, building web applications with **Next.js** and **Python**, and using **Shell scripting** for automation.
